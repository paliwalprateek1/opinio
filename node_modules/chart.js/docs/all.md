### Download Chart.js

To download a zip, go to [Chart.js on Github](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js) and choose the version that is right for your application.
* [Standard build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chartjs/Chart.js/master/dist/Chart.js) (~31kB gzipped)
* [Bundled with Moment.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chartjs/Chart.js/master/dist/Chart.bundle.js) (~45kB gzipped)
* [CDN Versions](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Chart.js)

To install via npm / bower:

```bash
npm install chart.js --save
```
```bash
bower install Chart.js --save
```

### Selecting the Correct Build

Chart.js provides two different builds that are available for your use. The `Chart.js` and `Chart.min.js` files include Chart.js and the accompanying color parsing library. If this version is used and you require the use of the time axis, [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) will need to be included before Chart.js.

The `Chart.bundle.js` and `Chart.bundle.min.js` builds include Moment.js in a single file. This version should be used if you require time axes and want a single file to include, select this version. Do not use this build if your application already includes Moment.js. If you do, Moment.js will be included twice, increasing the page load time and potentially introducing version issues.

### Installation

To import Chart.js using an old-school script tag:

```html
<script src="Chart.js"></script>
<script>
    var myChart = new Chart({...})
</script>
```

To import Chart.js using an awesome module loader:

```javascript

// Using CommonJS
var Chart = require('src/chart.js')
var myChart = new Chart({...})

// ES6
import Chart from 'src/chart.js'
let myChart = new Chart({...})

// Using requirejs
require(['path/to/Chartjs'], function(Chart){
 var myChart = new Chart({...})
})

```

### Creating a Chart

To create a chart, we need to instantiate the `Chart` class. To do this, we need to pass in the node, jQuery instance, or 2d context of the canvas of where we want to draw the chart. Here's an example.

```html
<canvas id="myChart" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
```

```javascript
// Any of the following formats may be used
var ctx = document.getElementById("myChart");
var ctx = document.getElementById("myChart").getContext("2d");
var ctx = $("#myChart");
```

Once you have the element or context, you're ready to instantiate a pre-defined chart-type or create your own!

The following example instantiates a bar chart showing the number of votes for different colors and the y-axis starting at 0.

```html
<canvas id="myChart" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
<script>
var ctx = document.getElementById("myChart");
var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {
        labels: ["Red", "Blue", "Yellow", "Green", "Purple", "Orange"],
        datasets: [{
            label: '# of Votes',
            data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3],
            backgroundColor: [
                'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
                'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
                'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)',
                'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
                'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)',
                'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)'
            ],
            borderColor: [
                'rgba(255,99,132,1)',
                'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)',
                'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
                'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)',
                'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)'
            ],
            borderWidth: 1
        }]
    },
    options: {
        scales: {
            yAxes: [{
                ticks: {
                    beginAtZero:true
                }
            }]
        }
    }
});
</script>
```

It's that easy to get started using Chart.js! From here you can explore the many options that can help you customise your charts with scales, tooltips, labels, colors, custom actions, and much more.

Chart.js provides a number of options for changing the behaviour of created charts. These configuration options can be changed on a per chart basis by passing in an options object when creating the chart. Alternatively, the global configuration can be changed which will be used by all charts created after that point.

### Creating a Chart with Options

To create a chart with configuration options, simply pass an object containing your configuration to the constructor. In the example below, a line chart is created and configured to not be responsive.

```javascript
var chartInstance = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: data,
    options: {
        responsive: false
    }
});
```

### Global Configuration

This concept was introduced in Chart.js 1.0 to keep configuration DRY, and allow for changing options globally across chart types, avoiding the need to specify options for each instance, or the default for a particular chart type.

Chart.js merges the options object passed to the chart with the global configuration using chart type defaults and scales defaults appropriately. This way you can be as specific as you would like in your individual chart configuration, while still changing the defaults for all chart types where applicable. The global general options are defined in `Chart.defaults.global`. The defaults for each chart type are discussed in the documentation for that chart type.

The following example would set the hover mode to 'single' for all charts where this was not overridden by the chart type defaults or the options passed to the constructor on creation.

```javascript
Chart.defaults.global.hover.mode = 'single';

// Hover mode is set to single because it was not overridden here
var chartInstanceHoverModeSingle = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: data,
});

// This chart would have the hover mode that was passed in
var chartInstanceDifferentHoverMode = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: data,
    options: {
        hover: {
            // Overrides the global setting
            mode: 'label'
        }
    }
})
```

#### Global Font Settings

There are 4 special global settings that can change all of the fonts on the chart. These options are in `Chart.defaults.global`.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
defaultFontColor | Color | '#666' | Default font color for all text
defaultFontFamily | String | "'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif" | Default font family for all text
defaultFontSize | Number | 12 | Default font size (in px) for text. Does not apply to radialLinear scale point labels
defaultFontStyle | String | 'normal' | Default font style. Does not apply to tooltip title or footer. Does not apply to chart title

### Common Chart Configuration

The following options are applicable to all charts. The can be set on the [global configuration](#chart-configuration-global-configuration), or they can be passed to the chart constructor.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
responsive | Boolean | true | Resizes when the canvas container does.
responsiveAnimationDuration | Number | 0 | Duration in milliseconds it takes to animate to new size after a resize event.
maintainAspectRatio | Boolean | true | Maintain the original canvas aspect ratio `(width / height)` when resizing
events | Array[String] | `["mousemove", "mouseout", "click", "touchstart", "touchmove", "touchend"]` | Events that the chart should listen to for tooltips and hovering
onClick | Function | null | Called if the event is of type 'mouseup' or 'click'. Called in the context of the chart and passed an array of active elements
legendCallback | Function | ` function (chart) { }` | Function to generate a legend. Receives the chart object to generate a legend from. Default implementation returns an HTML string.
onResize | Function | null | Called when a resize occurs. Gets passed two arguemnts: the chart instance and the new size.

### Title Configuration

The title configuration is passed into the `options.title` namespace. The global options for the chart title is defined in `Chart.defaults.global.title`.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
display | Boolean | false | Display the title block
position | String | 'top' | Position of the title. Only 'top' or 'bottom' are currently allowed
fullWidth | Boolean | true | Marks that this box should take the full width of the canvas (pushing down other boxes)

#### Example Usage

The example below would enable a title of 'Custom Chart Title' on the chart that is created.

```javascript
var chartInstance = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: data,
    options: {
        title: {
            display: true,
            text: 'Custom Chart Title'
        }
    }
})
```

#### Legend Item Interface

Items passed to the legend `onClick` function are the ones returned from `labels.generateLabels`. These items must implement the following interface.

```javascript
{
    // Label that will be displayed
    text: String,

    // Fill style of the legend box
    fillStyle: Color,

    // If true, this item represents a hidden dataset. Label will be rendered with a strike-through effect

```

#### Example

The following example will create a chart with the legend enabled and turn all of the text red in color.

```javascript
var chartInstance = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: data,
    options: {
        legend: {
            display: true,
            labels: {
                fontColor: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)'
            }
        }
    }
});
```

callbacks | Object | | See the [callbacks section](#chart-configuration-tooltip-callbacks) below

#### Tooltip Callbacks

The tooltip label configuration is nested below the tooltip configuration using the `callbacks` key. The tooltip has the following callbacks for providing text. For all functions, 'this' will be the tooltip object created from the Chart.Tooltip constructor. 

All functions are called with the same arguments: a [tooltip item](#chart-configuration-tooltip-item-interface) and the data object passed to the chart. All functions must return either a string or an array of strings. Arrays of strings are treated as multiple lines of text.

Callback | Arguments | Description
--- | --- | ---
beforeTitle | `Array[tooltipItem], data` | Text to render before the title
title | `Array[tooltipItem], data` | Text to render as the title
afterTitle | `Array[tooltipItem], data` | Text to render after the title
beforeBody | `Array[tooltipItem], data` | Text to render before the body section
beforeLabel | `tooltipItem, data` | Text to render before an individual label
label | `tooltipItem, data` | Text to render for an individual item in the tooltip
labelColor | `tooltipItem, chartInstace` | Returns the colors to render for the tooltip item. Return as an object containing two parameters: `borderColor` and `backgroundColor`.
afterLabel | `tooltipItem, data` | Text to render after an individual label
afterBody | `Array[tooltipItem], data` | Text to render after the body section
beforeFooter | `Array[tooltipItem], data` | Text to render before the footer section
footer | `Array[tooltipItem], data` | Text to render as the footer
afterFooter | `Array[tooltipItem], data` | Text to render after the footer section

#### Tooltip Item Interface

The tooltip items passed to the tooltip callbacks implement the following interface.

```javascript
{
    // X Value of the tooltip as a string
    xLabel: String,

    // Y value of the tooltip as a string
    yLabel: String,

    // Index of the dataset the item comes from
    datasetIndex: Number,

    // Index of this data item in the dataset
    index: Number
}
```

### Hover Configuration

The hover configuration is passed into the `options.hover` namespace. The global hover configuration is at `Chart.defaults.global.hover`.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
mode | String | 'single' | Sets which elements hover. Acceptable options are `'single'`, `'label'`, or `'dataset'`. `single` highlights the closest element. `label` highlights elements in all datasets at the same `X` value. `dataset` highlights the closest dataset.
animationDuration | Number | 400 | Duration in milliseconds it takes to animate hover style changes
onHover | Function | null | Called when any of the events fire. Called in the context of the chart and passed an array of active elements (bars, points, etc)

easing | String | "easeOutQuart" | Easing function to use.
onProgress | Function | none | Callback called on each step of an animation. Passed a single argument, an object, containing the chart instance and an object with details of the animation.
onComplete | Function | none | Callback called at the end of an animation. Passed the same arguments as `onProgress`

#### Animation Callbacks

The `onProgress` and `onComplete` callbacks are useful for synchronizing an external draw to the chart animation. The callback is passed an object that implements the following interface. An example usage of these callbacks can be found on [Github](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/master/samples/AnimationCallbacks/progress-bar.html). This sample displays a progress bar showing how far along the animation is.

```javscript
{
    // Chart object
    chartInstance,

    // Contains details of the on-going animation
    animationObject,
}
```

#### Animation Object

The animation object passed to the callbacks is of type `Chart.Animation`. The object has the following parameters.

```javascript
{
    // Current Animation frame number
    currentStep: Number,

    // Number of animation frames
    numSteps: Number,

    // Animation easing to use
    easing: String,

    // Function that renders the chart
    render: Function,

    // User callback
    onAnimationProgress: Function,

    // User callback
    onAnimationComplete: Function
}
```

### Element Configuration

The global options for elements are defined in `Chart.defaults.global.elements`.

Options can be configured for four different types of elements; arc, lines, points, and rectangles. When set, these options apply to all objects of that type unless specifically overridden by the configuration attached to a dataset.

#### Arc Configuration

Arcs are used in the polar area, doughnut and pie charts. They can be configured with the following options. The global arc options are stored in `Chart.defaults.global.elements.arc`.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
backgroundColor | Color | 'rgba(0,0,0,0.1)' | Default fill color for arcs. Inherited from the global default 
borderColor | Color | '#fff' | Default stroke color for arcs
borderWidth | Number | 2 | Default stroke width for arcs

#### Line Configuration

Line elements are used to represent the line in a line chart. The global line options are stored in `Chart.defaults.global.elements.line`.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
tension | Number | 0.4 | Default bezier curve tension. Set to `0` for no bezier curves.
backgroundColor | Color | 'rgba(0,0,0,0.1)' | Default line fill color
borderWidth | Number | 3 | Default line stroke width

fill | Boolean | true | If true, the line is filled.

#### Point Configuration

Point elements are used to represent the points in a line chart or a bubble chart. The global point options are stored in `Chart.defaults.global.elements.point`.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
radius | Number | 3 | Default point radius
pointStyle | String | 'circle' | Default point style

borderSkipped | String | 'bottom' | Default skipped (excluded) border for rectangle. Can be one of `bottom`, `left`, `top`, `right`

### Colors

When supplying colors to Chart options, you can use a number of formats. You can specify the color as a string in hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL notations. If a color is needed, but not specified, Chart.js will use the global default color. This color is stored at `Chart.defaults.global.defaultColor`. It is initially set to 'rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.1)';

You can also pass a [CanvasGradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasGradient) object. You will need to create this before passing to the chart, but using it you can achieve some interesting effects.

The final option is to pass a [CanvasPattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasPattern) object. For example, if you wanted to fill a dataset with a pattern from an image you could do the following.

```javascript
var img = new Image();
img.src = 'https://example.com/my_image.png';
img.onload = function() {
    var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
    var fillPattern = ctx.createPattern(img, 'repeat');

    var chart = new Chart(ctx, {
        data: {
            labels: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'],
            datasets: [{
                data: [10, 20, 30],
                backgroundColor: fillPattern
            }]
        }
    })
}

```


Scales in v2.0 of Chart.js are significantly more powerful, but also different than those of v1.0.
* Multiple X & Y axes are supported.
* A built-in label auto-skip feature detects would-be overlapping ticks and labels and removes every nth label to keep things displaying normally.
* Scale titles are supported
* New scale types can be extended without writing an entirely new chart type


### Common Configuration

Every scale extends a core scale class with the following options:

tickMarkLength | Number | 10 | Length in pixels that the grid lines will draw into the axis area.
zeroLineWidth | Number | 1 | Stroke width of the grid line for the first index (index 0).
zeroLineColor | Color | "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)" | Stroke color of the grid line for the first index (index 0).
offsetGridLines | Boolean | false | If true, offset labels from grid lines.

#### Scale Title Configuration

The grid line configuration is nested under the scale configuration in the `scaleLabel` key. It defines options for the scale title.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
display | Boolean | false |
labelString | String | "" | The text for the title. (i.e. "# of People", "Response Choices")
fontColor | Color | "#666" | Font color for the scale title.
fontFamily| String | "'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif" | Font family for the scale title, follows CSS font-family options.
fontSize | Number | 12 | Font size for the scale title.
fontStyle | String | "normal" | Font style for the scale title, follows CSS font-style options (i.e. normal, italic, oblique, initial, inherit).

#### Tick Configuration

The grid line configuration is nested under the scale configuration in the `ticks` key. It defines options for the tick marks that are generated by the axis.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
autoSkip | Boolean | true | If true, automatically calculates how many labels that can be shown and hides labels accordingly. Turn it off to show all labels no matter what
callback | Function | `function(value) { return helpers.isArray(value) ? value : '' + value; }` | Returns the string representation of the tick value as it should be displayed on the chart. See [callback](#scales-creating-custom-tick-formats) section below.
display | Boolean | true | If true, show the ticks.
fontColor | Color | "#666" | Font color for the tick labels.
fontFamily | String | "'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif" | Font family for the tick labels, follows CSS font-family options.
fontSize | Number | 12 | Font size for the tick labels.
fontStyle | String | "normal" | Font style for the tick labels, follows CSS font-style options (i.e. normal, italic, oblique, initial, inherit).
labelOffset | Number | 0 | Distance in pixels to offset the label from the centre point of the tick (in the y direction for the x axis, and the x direction for the y axis). *Note: this can cause labels at the edges to be cropped by the edge of the canvas*
maxRotation | Number | 90 | Maximum rotation for tick labels when rotating to condense labels. Note: Rotation doesn't occur until necessary. *Note: Only applicable to horizontal scales.*
minRotation | Number | 0 | Minimum rotation for tick labels. *Note: Only applicable to horizontal scales.*
mirror | Boolean | false | Flips tick labels around axis, displaying the labels inside the chart instead of outside. *Note: Only applicable to vertical scales.*
padding | Number | 10 | Padding between the tick label and the axis. *Note: Only applicable to horizontal scales.*
reverse | Boolean | false | Reverses order of tick labels.

#### Creating Custom Tick Formats

The `callback` method may be used for advanced tick customization. In the following example, every label of the Y axis would be displayed in scientific notation.

If the callback returns `null` or `undefined` the associated grid line will be hidden.

```javascript
var chartInstance = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: data,
    options: {
        scales: {
            yAxes: [{
                ticks: {
                    // Create scientific notation labels
                    callback: function(value, index, values) {
                        return value.toExponential();
                    }
                }
            }]
        }
    }
});
```

### Category Scale

The category scale will be familiar to those who have used v1.0. Labels are drawn in from the labels array included in the chart data.

#### Configuration Options

The category scale has the following additional options that can be set.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
ticks.min | String | - | The minimum item to display. Must be a value in the `labels` array
ticks.max | String | - | The maximum item to display. Must be a value in the `labels` array
gridLines.offsetGridLines | Boolean | - | If true, labels are shifted to be between grid lines. This is used in the bar chart.


### Linear Scale

The linear scale is use to chart numerical data. It can be placed on either the x or y axis. The scatter chart type automatically configures a line chart to use one of these scales for the x axis. As the name suggests, linear interpolation is used to determine where a value lies on the axis.

#### Configuration Options

The following options are provided by the linear scale. They are all located in the `ticks` sub options.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
beginAtZero | Boolean | - | if true, scale will inclulde 0 if it is not already included.
min | Number | - | User defined minimum number for the scale, overrides minimum value from data.
max | Number | - | User defined maximum number for the scale, overrides maximum value from data.
maxTicksLimit | Number | 11 | Maximum number of ticks and gridlines to show. If not defined, it will limit to 11 ticks but will show all gridlines.
stepSize | Number | - | User defined fixed step size for the scale. If set, the scale ticks will be enumerated by multiple of stepSize, having one tick per increment. If not set, the ticks are labeled automatically using the nice numbers algorithm.
stepSize | Number | - | if defined, it can be used along with the min and the max to give a custom number of steps. See the example below.
suggestedMax | Number | - | User defined maximum number for the scale, overrides maximum value *except for if* it is lower than the maximum value.
suggestedMin | Number | - | User defined minimum number for the scale, overrides minimum value *except for if* it is higher than the minimum value.

#### Example Configuration

The following example creates a line chart with a vertical axis that goes from 0 to 5 in 0.5 sized steps.

```javascript
var chartInstance = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: data,
    options: {
        scales: {
            yAxes: [{
                ticks: {
                    max: 5,
                    min: 0,
                    stepSize: 0.5
                }
            }]
        }
    }
});
```

### Logarithmic Scale

The logarithmic scale is use to chart numerical data. It can be placed on either the x or y axis. As the name suggests, logarithmic interpolation is used to determine where a value lies on the axis.

#### Configuration Options

The following options are provided by the logarithmic scale. They are all located in the `ticks` sub options.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
min | Number | - | User defined minimum number for the scale, overrides minimum value from data.
max | Number | - | User defined maximum number for the scale, overrides maximum value from data.

#### Example Configuration

The following example creates a chart with a logarithmic X axis that ranges from 1 to 1000.

```javascript
var chartInstance = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: data,
    options: {
        scales: {
            xAxes: [{
                type: 'logarithmic',
                position: 'bottom',
                ticks: {
                    min: 1,
                    max: 1000
                }
            }]
        }
    }
})
```

### Time Scale

The time scale is used to display times and dates. It can only be placed on the X axis. When building its ticks, it will automatically calculate the most comfortable unit base on the size of the scale.

#### Configuration Options

The following options are provided by the logarithmic scale. They are all located in the `time` sub options.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
displayFormats | Object | - | See [Display Formats](#scales-display-formats) section below.
isoWeekday | Boolean | false | If true and the unit is set to 'week', iso weekdays will be used.
max | [Time](#scales-date-formats) | - | If defined, this will override the data maximum
min | [Time](#scales-date-formats) | - | If defined, this will override the data minimum
parser | String or Function | - | If defined as a string, it is interpreted as a custom format to be used by moment to parse the date. If this is a function, it must return a moment.js object given the appropriate data value.
round | String | - | If defined, dates will be rounded to the start of this unit. See [Time Units](#scales-time-units) below for the allowed units.
tooltipFormat | String | '' | The moment js format string to use for the tooltip.
unit | String | - | If defined, will force the unit to be a certain type. See [Time Units](#scales-time-units) section below for details.
unitStepSize | Number | 1 | The number of units between grid lines. 

#### Date Formats

When providing data for the time scale, Chart.js supports all of the formats that Moment.js accepts. See [Moment.js docs](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/) for details.

#### Display Formats

The following display formats are used to configure how different time units are formed into strings for the axis tick marks. See [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) for the allowable format strings.

Name | Default 
--- | --- 
millisecond | 'SSS [ms]'
second | 'h:mm:ss a'
minute | 'h:mm:ss a'
hour | 'MMM D, hA'
day | 'll'
week | 'll'
month | 'MMM YYYY'
quarter | '[Q]Q - YYYY'
year | 'YYYY'

For example, to set the display format for the 'quarter' unit to show the month and year, the following config would be passed to the chart constructor.

```javascript
var chartInstance = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: data,
    options: {
        scales: {
            xAxes: [{
                type: 'time',
                time: {
                    displayFormats: {
                        quarter: 'MMM YYYY'
                    }
                }
            }]
        }
    }
})
```

#### Time Units

The following time measurements are supported. The names can be passed as strings to the `time.unit` config option to force a certain unit.

* millisecond
* second
* minute
* hour
* day
* week
* month
* quarter
* year

For example, to create a chart with a time scale that always displayed units per month, the following config could be used.

```javascript
var chartInstance = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: data,
    options: {
        scales: {
            xAxes: [{
                time: {
                    unit: 'month'
                }
            }]
        }
    }
})
```

### Radial Linear Scale

The radial linear scale is used specifically for the radar and polar are chart types. It overlays the chart area, rather than being positioned on one of the edges.

#### Configuration Options

The following additional configuration options are provided by the radial linear scale.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
lineArc | Boolean | false | If true, circular arcs are used else straight lines are used. The former is used by the polar area chart and the latter by the radar chart

pointLabels | Object | - | See the Point Label Options section below for details.
ticks | Object | - | See the Ticks table below for options.

#### Angle Line Options

The following options are used to configure angled lines that radiate from the center of the chart to the point labels. They can be found in the `angleLines` sub options. Note that these options only apply if `lineArc` is false.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
display | Boolean | true | If true, angle lines are shown. 
color | Color | 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)' | Color of angled lines
lineWidth | Number | 1 | Width of angled lines

#### Point Label Options

The following options are used to configure the point labels that are shown on the perimeter of the scale. They can be found in the `pointLabels` sub options. Note that these options only apply if `lineArc` is false.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
callback | Function | - | Callback function to transform data label to axis label
fontColor | Color | '#666' | Font color
fontFamily | String | "'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif" | Font family to render

fontStyle | String | 'normal' | Font Style to use


#### Tick Options

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
backdropColor | Color | 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75)' | Color of label backdrops
backdropPaddingX | Number | 2 | Horizontal padding of label backdrop
backdropPaddingY | Number | 2 | Vertical padding of label backdrop
beginAtZero | Boolean | - | if true, scale will inclulde 0 if it is not already included.
min | Number | - | User defined minimum number for the scale, overrides minimum value from data.
max | Number | - | User defined maximum number for the scale, overrides maximum value from data.
maxTicksLimit | Number | 11 | Maximum number of ticks and gridlines to show. If not defined, it will limit to 11 ticks but will show all gridlines.
showLabelBackdrop | Boolean | true | If true, draw a background behind the tick labels

stepSize | Number | - | if defined, it can be used along with the min and the max to give a custom number of steps. See the example below.
suggestedMax | Number | - | User defined maximum number for the scale, overrides maximum value *except for if* it is lower than the maximum value.
suggestedMin | Number | - | User defined minimum number for the scale, overrides minimum value *except for if* it is higher than the minimum value.

### Update Default Scale config

The default configuration for a scale can be easily changed using the scale service. Pass in a partial configuration that will be merged with the current scale default configuration.

For example, to set the minimum value of 0 for all linear scales, you would do the following. Any linear scales created after this time would now have a minimum of 0.
```
Chart.scaleService.updateScaleDefaults('linear', {
    ticks: {
        min: 0
    }
})
```


### Introduction
A line chart is a way of plotting data points on a line. Often, it is used to show trend data, and the comparison of two data sets.

<div class="canvas-holder">
	<canvas width="250" height="125"></canvas>
</div>

### Example Usage
```javascript
var myLineChart = new Chart(ctx, {
	type: 'line',
	data: data,
	options: options
});
```

Alternatively a line chart can be created using syntax similar to the v1.0 syntax
```javascript
var myLineChart = Chart.Line(ctx, {
	data: data,
	options: options
});
```

### Data Structure

The following options can be included in a line chart dataset to configure options for that specific dataset.

All point* properties can be specified as an array. If these are set to an array value, the first value applies to the first point, the second value to the second point, and so on.

Property | Type | Usage
--- | --- | ---
data | See [data point](#line-chart-data-points) section | The data to plot in a line
label | `String` | The label for the dataset which appears in the legend and tooltips
xAxisID | `String` | The ID of the x axis to plot this dataset on
yAxisID | `String` | The ID of the y axis to plot this dataset on
fill | `Boolean` | If true, fill the area under the line
lineTension | `Number` | Bezier curve tension of the line. Set to 0 to draw straightlines. *Note* This was renamed from 'tension' but the old name still works.
backgroundColor | `Color` | The fill color under the line. See [Colors](#getting-started-colors)
borderWidth | `Number` | The width of the line in pixels
borderColor | `Color` | The color of the line.
borderCapStyle | `String` | Cap style of the line. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineCap)
borderDash | `Array<Number>` | Length and spacing of dashes. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/setLineDash)
borderDashOffset | `Number` | Offset for line dashes. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineDashOffset)
borderJoinStyle | `String` | Line joint style. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineJoin)
pointBorderColor | `Color or Array<Color>` | The border color for points.
pointBackgroundColor | `Color or Array<Color>` | The fill color for points
pointBorderWidth | `Number or Array<Number>` | The width of the point border in pixels
pointRadius | `Number or Array<Number>` | The radius of the point shape. If set to 0, nothing is rendered. 
pointHoverRadius | `Number or Array<Number>` | The radius of the point when hovered
pointHitRadius | `Number or Array<Number>` | The pixel size of the non-displayed point that reacts to mouse events
pointHoverBackgroundColor | `Color or Array<Color>` | Point background color when hovered
pointHoverBorderColor | `Color or Array<Color>` | Point border color when hovered
pointHoverBorderWidth | `Number or Array<Number>` | Border width of point when hovered
pointStyle | `String, Array<String>, Image, Array<Image>` | The style of point. Options are 'circle', 'triangle', 'rect', 'rectRot', 'cross', 'crossRot', 'star', 'line', and 'dash'. If the option is an image, that image is drawn on the canvas using `drawImage`. 
showLine | `Boolean` | If false, the line is not drawn for this dataset
spanGaps | `Boolean` | If true, lines will be drawn between points with no or null data

An example data object using these attributes is shown below.
```javascript
var data = {
	labels: ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July"],
	datasets: [
		{
			label: "My First dataset",
			fill: false,
			lineTension: 0.1,
			backgroundColor: "rgba(75,192,192,0.4)",
			borderColor: "rgba(75,192,192,1)",
			borderCapStyle: 'butt',
			borderDash: [],
			borderDashOffset: 0.0,
			borderJoinStyle: 'miter',
			pointBorderColor: "rgba(75,192,192,1)",
			pointBackgroundColor: "#fff",
			pointBorderWidth: 1,
			pointHoverRadius: 5,
			pointHoverBackgroundColor: "rgba(75,192,192,1)",
			pointHoverBorderColor: "rgba(220,220,220,1)",
			pointHoverBorderWidth: 2,
			pointRadius: 1,
			pointHitRadius: 10,
			data: [65, 59, 80, 81, 56, 55, 40],
			spanGaps: false,
		}
	]
};
```

The line chart usually requires an array of labels. This labels are shown on the X axis. There must be one label for each data point. More labels than datapoints are allowed, in which case the line ends at the last data point.
The data for line charts is broken up into an array of datasets. Each dataset has a colour for the fill, a colour for the line and colours for the points and strokes of the points. These colours are strings just like CSS. You can use RGBA, RGB, HEX or HSL notation.

The label key on each dataset is optional, and can be used when generating a scale for the chart.

When `spanGaps` is set to true, the gaps between points in sparse datasets are filled in. By default, it is off.

### Data Points

The data passed to the chart can be passed in two formats. The most common method is to pass the data array as an array of numbers. In this case, the `data.labels` array must be specified and must contain a label for each point or, in the case of labels to be displayed over multiple lines an array of labels (one for each line) i.e `[["June","2015"], "July"]`.

The alternate is used for sparse datasets. Data is specified using an object containing `x` and `y` properties. This is used for scatter charts as documented below.

### Scatter Line Charts

Scatter line charts can be created by changing the X axis to a linear axis. To use a scatter chart, data must be passed as objects containing X and Y properties. The example below creates a scatter chart with 3 points.

```javascript
var scatterChart = new Chart(ctx, {
	type: 'line',
	data: {
		datasets: [{
			label: 'Scatter Dataset',
			data: [{
				x: -10,
				y: 0
			}, {
				x: 0,
				y: 10
			}, {
				x: 10,
				y: 5
			}]
		}]
	},
	options: {
		scales: {
			xAxes: [{
				type: 'linear',
				position: 'bottom'
			}]
		}
	}
});
```

### Chart Options

These are the customisation options specific to Line charts. These options are merged with the [global chart configuration options](#chart-configuration-global-configuration), and form the options of the chart.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
showLines | Boolean | true | If false, the lines between points are not drawn

You can override these for your `Chart` instance by passing a member `options` into the `Line` method.

For example, we could have a line chart display without an X axis by doing the following. The config merge is smart enough to handle arrays so that you do not need to specify all axis settings to change one thing.

```javascript
new Chart(ctx, {
	type: 'line',
	data: data,
	options: {
		scales: {
			xAxes: [{
				display: false
			}]
		}
	}
});
```

We can also change these defaults values for each Line type that is created, this object is available at `Chart.defaults.line`.

### Stacked Charts

Stacked area charts can be created by setting the Y axis to a stacked configuration. The following example would have stacked lines.

```javascript
var stackedLine = new Chart(ctx, {
	type: 'line',
	data: data,
	options: {
		scales: {
			yAxes: [{
				stacked: true
			}]
		}
	}
});
```
